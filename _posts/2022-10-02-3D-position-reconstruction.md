In this project, different neural networks are used to reconstruct the three-dimensional position of an event in a detector. In fact, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) and CNN-LSTM architectures are applied.

# Project Overview  <a name="overview-main"></a>

### Dark Matter <a name="overview-darkmatter"></a>

The universe is thought to consist of three different types of matter: baryonic matter, dark
matter, and dark energy. Most of the matter in the universe, according to standard gravitational theory, is in a form that is unknown to us and does not emit enough light to have been detected by current instrumentation. Researchers from around the world are working to
finally uncover the properties and possible physical candidates of this dark matter. Evidence
for dark matter exists from the large to the small scale, here one instance will be taken up
in more detail.

The stellar mass-luminosity relation can be applied to determine the mass M of a main
sequence star as a function of its mere luminosity L via the relation L ∝ Mα with α ≈ 3
for large masses and α ≈ 4 for small masses [9]. However, if one measures the rotational
velocity of stars as a function of their distance from the galactic center, the mass-luminosity
relation gives a much smaller mass than that obtained by applying Kepler’s laws. As an
instance, the galaxy NGC 3198, to be seen in figure 2.1, can be mentioned: For large radii
r, an almost constant value was measured for the rotation velocity v, the predicted decay
according to Kepler’s law, following v ∝ 1, could not be observed. Consequently, there
must be mass present in the galaxy, which does not contribute to the radiation emission. If
one looks at typical rotation curves of galaxies, this dark matter cannot be explained only
by a black hole in the center of the galaxies [29]. Rather, it can be concluded that it must be
spatially distributed in a galaxy, nearly uniformly. If a dark matter halo is introduced, these
observations can be physically reproduced. This halo neither absorbs nor emits radiation, it
dominates the total mass in the universe.
